# zeppelin-App

## This application has 2 views Dispatcher & Service Staff based on my understanding for the technical solution.

### Main Features for the 2 views

#### In the dispatcher view:
  - The user can filter the data with customer names
  - The user can sort the contracts by the expired or valid
  - The user can see the total expired contracts and warranties of all customers
  - The user can see the total expired contracts and warranties of a specific customer
  - The user can sort the machines by name

#### In the service staff view:
  - When the user seaarch for a machine with it's serial number ,A QR code appears to give the user the option to either scan the QR code and search for       the serial number on a public url belongs to zeppelin(currently I use google.com), or search in the internal system and get the machine full data
  - If the user entered an invalid serial number, an error message will appear
  - The user can re-enter another serial number
  
  
All the code is in ```develop``` branch
